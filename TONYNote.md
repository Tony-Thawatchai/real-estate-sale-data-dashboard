#### How I approach this challenge
1. draw a simple mock to see the end result

[View the mockup](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rX1GRJkGaLbd0dkJp0HHIj3HV4ub4Nqv/view?usp=sharing)

2. build the table component first
# since it is the most important component on this page. And also, it is can use for as tester for other filtering component

3. build the filter form component

4. build the get user location 

5. build the map using user location as display and create marker from filtered data

6. build the "At a glance" component to show overview data in the period

7. build the historical data to show price change overtime by each unit type

8. build the "get started" component (prompt the user with frequently filtered data for better UX)

9. build AI chat bot where is use the CSV as knowledge-base and give answer base on that
