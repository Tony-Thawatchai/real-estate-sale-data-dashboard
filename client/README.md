## The challenge

This repository contains a boilerplate Create React App. We have provided you a `/src/data` directory that includes a simplified dataset of MLS real estate transactions in Vancouver.

Your challenge is to build a simple web app that allows users to visualize the data in a meaningful way.

### Requirements

- Use the provided resale data in `/src/data` (sample Vancouver resale data from 2023, excludes single-family homes)
- Use a mapping library to visualize the data on a map. We recommend [Google Maps](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform) or [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). For our company's data product, we use Mapbox.
- Develop UI to allow users to interact with, filter, and explore the data.
- Make regular, meaningful commits that reflect the logical progression of your work

### Evaluation

- We are looking for your ability to explore and present data in a meaningful way for end users.
- We are looking for your ability to use external libraries to solve a problem.
- We are looking for your ability to create a pleasant and intuitive UI.
- We are looking for your ability to write clean, organized code.
- We are looking for your ability to communicate via commit messages why certain changes were made and not just what was done.
- We are not looking for back-end functionality, so don't worry about creating an API or database.

### Helpful libraries

- [Google Maps](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform)
- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
- [Turf](https://turfjs.org/)
